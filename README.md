AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machinery

***Project Overview:***

The AI-powered predictive maintenance system for industrial machinery has been successfully developed and deployed. It continuously monitors real-time sensor data from various machines, including vibration, acoustic emissions, temperature, and pressure. By leveraging advanced numerical techniques, the system predicts potential failures, optimizes maintenance schedules, and ensures peak operational efficiency.

Signal Processing using DFT: The system applies the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to sensor data to convert time-domain signals into the frequency domain. This enables real-time detection of anomalies, such as mechanical faults or excessive vibrations. The AI then uses these frequency patterns to flag early signs of equipment degradation, helping prevent costly breakdowns.

Predictive Modeling with Newton's Divided Difference: Newton's divided difference interpolation is used to build a predictive model based on historical sensor data. The model forecasts key performance indicators (KPIs) like energy consumption, temperature, and pressure, allowing the system to estimate future machine conditions and plan maintenance in advance. The system continuously updates the model, ensuring predictions remain accurate as the machinery operates over time.

Optimization through Newton's Method: Newton’s method is implemented to optimize machine performance. For example, the system calculates the optimal operational thresholds for temperature and pressure to avoid mechanical stress and extend the machinery's lifespan. By automatically adjusting these parameters, the system keeps the machines running efficiently, reducing energy consumption and wear.

Robustness to Runge's Phenomenon: The system was carefully designed to avoid overfitting by accounting for Runge’s phenomenon. This ensures that the interpolation model used for predicting future machine behavior does not become overly complex and remains generalizable to new, unseen data. The system strikes a balance between accuracy and stability, ensuring reliable predictions across different operating conditions.
